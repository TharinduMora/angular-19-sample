    Hydration is the process that restores the server-side rendered application
    on the client. This includes things like reusing the server rendered DOM
    structures, persisting the application state, transferring application data
    that was retrieved already by the server, and other processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server sends a ready-made HTML page to the browser. Then, Angular starts
    on the client side, reuses the existing HTML, and adds functionality like
    event handling.

  <p>
    <br />
    Key Points:
    <li>
      <b>Server Rendering:</b> The server creates the HTML, which helps with
      faster loading and better SEO.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Hydration:</b> The browser uses the server's HTML without re-creating
      it, making the process faster and smoother.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Benefits:</b> Pages load quickly, search engines can read the content
      easily, and thereâ€™s no flickering.
    </li>
  </p>

  <p>
    How It Works:
    <li>The server creates and sends the HTML.</li>
    <li>The browser shows the static page.</li>
    <li>Angular makes the page interactive.</li>
  </p>

  <p>Hydration makes server-rendered pages fully functional in the browser.</p>
